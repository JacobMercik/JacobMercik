## Hi there, I'm Jacob Mercik 👋

I’m a 38-year-old developer based in Poland, currently obsessed with market efficiency and automated trading systems. 

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** Optimizing my **Polymarket Arbitrage Bot**. After 4 months of heavy lifting in development, the system is officially **Live**, capturing real-time price gaps and executing automated trades across prediction markets.
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning:** Advanced latency optimization and cross-chain liquidity patterns to make my execution even faster.
- 💬 **Ask me about:** Prediction markets, arbitrage strategies, and the logic behind identifying "opportunity gaps" in decentralized data.
- 📫 **How to reach me:** [Insert your Email/Twitter/Telegram here]
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I spent 120 days straight staring at Polymarket order books so you don't have to.

### 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools
- **Languages:** Python / JavaScript (Node.js) / Solidity
- **Niche:** DeFi Automation, Web3 Integration, Arbitrage Logic
- **Platform:** Polymarket / Polygon Network
